# Description
Witty Cloud is a development board with an ESP8266 chip and LUA interpretor. It has a WiFi controller, a LED soldered to its output pins and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) soldered to its input pin. This simple script sets up a webserver that sends current LDR reading as a response, which can then be used by external applications (e.g. seeing if a light in the bathroom is on).
